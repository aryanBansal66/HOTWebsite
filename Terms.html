                    8.	TAXES PAYABLE
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    8.1	A 28% GST is applicable on the amount spent by you when purchasing coins in the app. You can view the GST paid on each coin purchase on the ‘My Transactions’ page within the app. The GST amount listed on the invoice will be the final GST charged to you.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Example:
                    •	Amount 100 Coin to be Purchased: ₹1000
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    •	GST (28%): ₹1000 × 28% = ₹280
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    •	Total Amount Charged: ₹1000 (coins) + ₹280 (GST) = ₹1280
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In this example, if you purchase coins worth ₹1000, the GST charged will be ₹280, making the total amount payable ₹1280.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    8.2	TDS Deductions on Net Winnings:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    8.2.1	TDS Deductions on Net Winnings:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    a)	What is 'Net Winnings'? Net Winnings is calculated as the difference between the total amount withdrawn and the total amount deposited in a financial year.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Example:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    •	Total Deposit: ₹4000
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    •	Total Withdrawal: ₹6000
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    •	Net Winnings: ₹6000 - ₹4000 = ₹2000
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    b)	How is Tax Calculated? Tax is calculated at a rate of 30% on the Net Winnings at the time of withdrawal or at the end of the financial year (31st March).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Example:
                    •	Net Winnings: ₹2000
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    •	Tax: 30% of ₹2000 = ₹600
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    c)	When Will the Tax Be Deducted? The tax will be deducted either at the time of withdrawal or on 31st March (end of the financial year). The total tax liability for the year will be calculated and deducted from the user's wallet.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    d)	What if My Withdrawal is Less than My Total Deposits? If the total withdrawal is less than the total deposit, no tax will be deducted.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Example:
                    •	Total Deposit: ₹7000
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    •	Total Withdrawal: ₹5000
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    •	Net Winnings: ₹5000 - ₹7000 = -₹2000 (Negative Net Winnings)
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Since Net Winnings is negative, no tax will be deducted.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    e)	Consideration of Opening Account Balance at the Start of the Financial Year: At the end of the Financial Year, if you have any amount remaining in your App’s account, tax will be deducted from that amount considering it a “withdrawal”. The remaining amount will be carried forward to the new Financial Year.

                    Net Winnings Calculation: = (Total Withdrawal) + (Closing Balance) - (Total Deposit) - (Opening Balance) = ₹4500 + ₹1500 - ₹3000 - ₹1000 = ₹2000

                    •	Tax Paid Earlier: ₹400
